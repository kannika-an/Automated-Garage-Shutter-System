# Automated-Garage-Shutter-System
Developed an Arduino-based automated garage shutter using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for real-time vehicle detection. Implemented embedded C logic with PWM-controlled servo actuation and 741 op-amp signal conditioning to ensure reliable, hands-free access control.
